# BiologicalMotionExperiment
### *Project: Biological motion for visual cortex induced phosphenes*

The map Figure_Generation_MATLAB contains the code for the generation of videos of a biological motion walker various frame duration with a certain limited lifetime. This code requires you to download Psychtoolbox and Biomotion toolbox. 

For running the experiment, use the code in src:
Lynn_BiMoExp_fun is a file that can be used in two ways:
  1. Run the file to start the experiment 
  2. Import the file into another python code to use the class methods 
    <br> (`from Lynn_BiMoExp_fun import Running_experiment`). An example run code is included in the src map, to show how you can import and use the file.
<br>
When running the file, you must have the maps: introduction, experiment, and experiment data in the same directory. It is important that the maps are organized in this way.
OpenCV is needs to be downloaded to run the program.
